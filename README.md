# NodeJS

understanding of global object

importing modules
- Modules protect their variables and functions from leaking by default in order to avoid conflicts
- we need to export them in order to access them
- whatever is exported in a module, will be returned whenever that module is imported using require()
- destructuring using {}

- Node.js automatically resolves the file extensions
